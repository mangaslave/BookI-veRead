# ðŸ“š Book I've Read

**Book I've Read** is a PHP project born from my short memory and a constant need to remember *what the heck I was thinking* when I finished that one mundane book.

## ðŸ§  Why?

Ever read a book, closed it, and immediately forgot the plot, characters, or the life-changing idea you swore youâ€™d remember forever? Yeah, same. This project helps me keep track of books I've read and, more importantly, my thoughts and impressions right after reading them â€” the raw, honest ones.

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack

- **PHP** â€“ backend logic
- **Laravel** â€“ framework for routing, database, and templating
- **PostgreSQL** â€“ to store all my deep (and sometimes not-so-deep) thoughts
- **Blade** â€“ for clean UI templating
- **Tailwind CSS** â€“ to keep things looking nice without trying too hard
- **Laravel Dusk** â€“ browser testing (because clicking through the UI gets boring)

## ðŸ““ Features

- Search for books via external API
- Add a book
- Write your review or personal thoughts
- Track your list of read books
- Clean and responsive UI
- Flash messages for user feedback (success/failure)
- (Optional) Format dropdown for categorizing how you consumed the book (e.g., Audiobook, E-book, etc.)

## ðŸ’­ Future Ideas

- Tags or moods for each book (e.g., boring, deep, overhyped)
- "Random Thought" generator from past entries
- Export as a reading journal
- Emoji reactions to your past reviews
